Custodes - Darcy - 76/76 - 10/15/2022 - My Place
 * Sorc Prowess was hard bc of high wound count.
 * Got my flamers stuck in combat after splitting fire like a chump. 
 * Feeding/screening MCU Rubrics worked well. Consider cheaper units w/o Soul Repear.
 * 3x solo spawns are my style, screen then steal or contest objectives wo Obsec
 * Forgot to put units in cover even though I was right next to it
 * Action AND Shoot SOCs need to teleport to diff quarters more
 
 Orcs - Earl - 98096 - 9/28/2022 - Sarges
 * Orcs are squishy
 * Characters are annoying but not that scary
 * Forgot to interrogate like an idiot.
