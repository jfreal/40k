Nids - Sean - 66/42 - 12/4/2022 - Seans House
 * They were shooty nids and I left everyone exposed and out of cover because I thought I had the better guns... he did
 * Verify what units are good at. I hid from stabby bugs, and left myself open to shooty bugs
 * Removing all the obsec models was key
 * I left his psychic units alone which was ok because I could deny, but he could deny back
 * Remember to keep the guy with the cyrstal within 6 of good teleport units

Custodes - Darcy - 76/76 - 10/15/2022 - My Place
 * Sorc Prowess was hard bc of high wound count.
 * Got my flamers stuck in combat after splitting fire like a chump. 
 * Feeding/screening MCU Rubrics worked well. Consider cheaper units w/o Soul Repear.
 * 3x solo spawns are my style, screen then steal or contest objectives wo Obsec
 * Forgot to put units in cover even though I was right next to it
 * Action AND Shoot SOCs need to teleport to diff quarters more
 
 Orcs - Earl - 98096 - 9/28/2022 - Sarges
 * Orcs are squishy
 * Characters are annoying but not that scary
 * Forgot to interrogate like an idiot.

Astra Militarum - Sean 6/2023
 * Board presence is key as shifting me off points was hard.
 * It wasn'tas  good to be aggressive with SOT because the -1 to hit from Big Gun Never Tire is easily overcome by Heavy or other rules.

Duos RTT at Clever Kobold
 * We could have lost some primary here and there by not focusing on units on objectives.
 * It was good to hold back resources at times so strike later.
 * Positioning tricks are key for Eldar.
 * If I get flustered or think I'm moving too fast, I have to pause and think through everything
 * High-cost units on the flakes are lame because they can't do as much.
 * Remember Infernal Master 6's
